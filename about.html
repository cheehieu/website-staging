				<p>My name is Hieu. I'm currently a systems applications engineer working on embedded processors in Dallas, TX. My interests change from time to time, but I've always enjoyed building things, working with my hands, and exploring the natural (and virtual) world around me. Outside of engineering, I like to play soccer and have recently started adventuring <em>off</em> the ground&mdash;into the ocean, and the sky!</p>

				<p>I, uh... I've got some bad news.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, this website wasn't created for hedgehogs or hedgehog enthusiasts. It was actually just created as a personal website to document my projects, thoughts, and experiences. Truth is, I've had very little interaction with hedgehogs in the real world (I know, <em>I'm a phony!</em>). So instead of seeing adorable baby hedgehogs like the one below, you'll find more information about who I am, what my interests/aspirations are, and what I'm currently working on.</p>
				<p>Sorry about that. <svg class="icon icon-wondering"><use xlink:href="#icon-wondering"></use></svg></p>

				<p><em>NiftyHedgehog</em> is my minimalist approach to web-presence with almost no financial cost or design knack required. The only cost incurred is for the domain name (approximately $10/year). All web content, project pages included, is hosted entirely by <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. Blog posts are created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which also delivers the unified web experience using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap's</a> responsive, mobile-first framework. Although not heavily utilized, <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> is used to promote a social environment across the site. Find out more about the inner workings <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/niftyorigins">HERE</a>!</p>
				<!--Google Analytics, monetization with ChangeTip digital currency. A simple, free email service through Zoho Mail,-->
				<p>The domain name originates from a childhood fascination with Sonic the Hedgehog. In my younger years, I spent a lot of time reading his comic books and playing the video games; running fast and collecting gold rings became my priorities... and in some ways, remnants of those priorities are instilled today. The words "nifty" and "hedgehog" are a play on my real name's initials. Take the reverse initialism of the domain and you get "HN", the initials for Hieu Nguyen. Yes, it's obscure and extremely nonsensical, but that's how it truly happened.</p>
