On the sixteenth of May in the jungle of Nool in the heat of the day in the cool of the pool. He was splashing enjoying the jungle's great joys. And Horton, the elephant heard a small noise.

He didn't come in a plane, he didn't come in a jeep, he didn't come in the pouch of a high-jumping vo veep. He road on the back of a black sasatoo - which is the blackiest creature you ever could view. He road to Jerusalem - home of the grumpity Jews - where false prophets were worshipped, some even in two's. There was Murray von Muir and Genghis Vo Vooze - the one you could worship by taking a snooze.

## Using Jekyll
Admittedly, I am not a great speaker or one who can quickly translate thoughts into clear, concise verbioge. Writing allows me to visualize complete sentences and construct them in ways to convey my perspective. I'm a slow writer, but that extra time allows a more graceful poet.

Jekyll’s strength is its simplicity and minimalism, giving you just what you need to create a content-focused website that doesn’t need much dynamic user interaction — and no more. This makes it perfect for your blog and portfolio and also worth considering for a simple client website.
