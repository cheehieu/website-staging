				<p>On the sixteenth of May in the jungle of Nool in the heat of the day in the cool of the pool. He was splashing enjoying the jungle's great joys. And Horton, the elephant heard a small noise.</p>
				<p>He didn't come in a plane, he didn't come in a jeep, he didn't come in the pouch of a high-jumping vo veep. He road on the back of a black sasatoo - which is the blackiest creature you ever could view. He road to Jerusalem - home of the grumpity Jews - where false prophets were worshipped, some even in two's. There was Murray von Muir and Genghis Vo Vooze - the one you could worship by taking a snooze.</p>

				<p>One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish, Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish. This one has a littlecar. This one has a little star. Say! What a lot of fish there are.</p>
				<p>Yes. Some are red, and some are blue. Some are old and some are new. Some are sad, and some are glad, And some are very, very bad. Why are they sad and glad and bad? I do not know, go ask your dad. Some are thin, and some are fat. The fat one has a yellow hat. From there to here, From here to there, Funny things are everywhere. Here are some who like to run. They run for fun in the hot, hot sun. Oh me! Oh my! Oh me! oh my! What a lot of funny things go by.</p>
				<p>Some have two feet and some have four. Some have six feet and some have more. Where do they come from? I can't say. But I bet they have come a long, long way. we see them come, we see them go. Some are fast. Some are slow. Some are high. Some are low. Not one of them is like another. Don't ask us why, go ask your mother.</p>
				<!--p>My "day job" profession as an electrical engineer keeps me focused on hardware systems, but I've had a long-term interest in human-computer interaction, in which web/mobile interfaces provide a huge amount of ___. I've self-taught myself simple HTML/CSS for creating personal websites with static content, but the design has mostly been minimalistic. While I believe simplicity is beautiful, I realize design is intricate in providing a good user experience.</p>
				<p>Admittedly, I am not a great speaker or one who can quickly translate thoughts into clear, concise verbioge. Writing allows me to visualize complete sentences and construct them in ways to convey my perspective. I'm a slow writer, but that extra time allows a more graceful poet.</p>
				<p>Jekyll’s strength is its simplicity and minimalism, giving you just what you need to create a content-focused website that doesn’t need much dynamic user interaction — and no more. This makes it perfect for your blog and portfolio and also worth considering for a simple client website.</p-->
